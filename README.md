I HAVE CONSIDERED 3 TYPES OF VEHICLES TO BE PARKED IN PARKING ZONE:-
1) RICKSHAW    PARKING FEE=100
2)CARS         PARKING FEE=200
3)BUSES        PARKING FEE=300

MAXIMUM NO. OF VEHICLES TO BE ACCOMODATED IN THE PARKING AREA IS 50.
THEN YOU WILL BE SEEING THE RECORD OF ALL THE VEHICLES ALONGWITH THE TOTAL AMOUNT GENERATED.
YOU MAY DELETE/CLEAR THE PREVIOUS RECORDS AS PER USE.
